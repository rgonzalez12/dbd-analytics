# Principal Engineer Production Improvements

This document outlines the three key improvements implemented based on principal engineer feedback to enhance production readiness and operational debugging capabilities.

## 1. Timeout Duration as Configuration ✅

### Problem
Hard-coded 5-second timeout for Steam API achievements fetch made it impossible to tune performance without redeployment.

### Solution
- Added `AchievementsTimeoutSecs` field to `APIConfig` struct
- Created `getAchievementsTimeout()` helper function with environment variable support
- Updated `NewClient()` to use configurable timeout
- Added validation with fallback to sensible defaults

### Configuration
```bash
# Environment variable (default: 5s)
ACHIEVEMENTS_TIMEOUT_SECS=10

# API config integration
config.AchievementsTimeout = 10 * time.Second
```

### Benefits
- Runtime configuration without deployment
- Environment-specific tuning (dev vs prod)
- Automatic fallback to safe defaults
- Comprehensive test coverage

## 2. Log Trace ID / Player ID Context ✅

### Problem
Debugging per-request issues was difficult when multiple requests hit simultaneously, lacking player context correlation.

### Solution
- Created `logSteamError()` and `logSteamInfo()` helper functions
- Added `player_id` field to all Steam API log lines
- Updated all Steam client methods to use contextual logging
- Enhanced log correlation across the entire request lifecycle

### Example Logs
```json
{
  "level": "INFO",
  "msg": "Starting player summary request",
  "player_id": "76561198000000000",
  "steam_id_or_vanity": "76561198000000000"
}

{
  "level": "ERROR", 
  "msg": "Steam ID resolution failed",
  "player_id": "invalid_user",
  "error": "Invalid vanity URL format"
}
```

### Log Analysis Enhancement
```bash
# Find all logs for a specific player
cat logs.json | jq 'select(.player_id == "76561198000000000")'

# Trace player request flow
cat logs.json | jq 'select(.player_id == "76561198000000000") | {time, level, msg, duration}'
```

### Benefits
- Instant request correlation by player ID
- Faster debugging of player-specific issues
- Consistent logging patterns across codebase
- Enhanced observability for production troubleshooting

---

## 3. Combined Repeated Error Handling ✅

### Problem
Steam API error logging was repeated across multiple functions with similar wording and inconsistent context.

### Solution
- Created `logSteamError()` centralized error logging function
- Standardized error logging with consistent fields and format
- Unified player context across all error scenarios
- Reduced code duplication and improved maintainability

### Before
```go
log.Error("Steam ID resolution failed", 
    "steam_id_or_vanity", steamIDOrVanity,
    "error", err.Message,
    "duration", time.Since(start))
```

### After
```go
logSteamError("ERROR", "Steam ID resolution failed", steamIDOrVanity, 
    fmt.Errorf(err.Message), "duration", time.Since(start))
```

### Benefits
- DRY principle: Single source of truth for error logging
- Consistent error formatting across all Steam API calls
- Easier to modify logging behavior globally
- Reduced chance of missing context in error logs
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

---

## Testing Coverage

All improvements include comprehensive test coverage:

- **Timeout Configuration**: 5 test scenarios covering defaults, valid/invalid values, edge cases
- **Player Context Logging**: Integration tests verify player_id appears in all log entries
- **Error Handling**: Existing error handling tests validate centralized logging works correctly

## Production Impact

### Operational Benefits
1. **Faster Debugging**: Player ID correlation reduces MTTR for user-specific issues
2. **Runtime Tuning**: Timeout configuration allows performance optimization without deployment
3. **Consistent Monitoring**: Standardized error patterns improve alerting and dashboards

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal**: New logging fields add ~20 bytes per log entry
- **Configurable**: Timeout tuning can improve or adjust performance as needed
- **Optimized**: Centralized error handling reduces code execution paths

### Backward Compatibility
- All changes are backward compatible
- Default values maintain existing behavior
- Environment variables are optional with sensible fallbacks

## Environment Variables Reference

```bash
# Steam API Configuration
ACHIEVEMENTS_TIMEOUT_SECS=5        # Achievements fetch timeout (default: 5s)

# Logging Configuration  
LOG_LEVEL=info                     # Log level (default: info)

# API Configuration (existing)
API_TIMEOUT_SECS=10               # General API timeout
OVERALL_TIMEOUT_SECS=30           # Overall operation timeout
```

## Verification

Run comprehensive tests to verify all improvements:

```bash
# Test timeout configuration
go test ./internal/steam -run TestAchievementsTimeoutConfiguration -v

# Test overall functionality
go test ./... -v

# Build production binary
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o bin/dbd-analytics-production-ready.exe cmd/app/main.go
```

**Status**: ✅ All three improvements successfully implemented and tested  
**Impact**: Enhanced production debugging, operational flexibility, and code maintainability  
**Risk**: Low - All changes are backward compatible with comprehensive test coverage
