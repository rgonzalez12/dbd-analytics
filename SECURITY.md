# Security & Production Readiness

## Completed Security Measures

### Error Handling
- [x] Structured error responses with consistent format
- [x] No sensitive information in error messages
- [x] Proper HTTP status codes
- [x] Request ID tracking for error correlation

### Rate Limiting
- [x] Global rate limiting (100 req/min per IP)
- [x] Token bucket algorithm
- [x] Steam API rate limit handling with backoff
- [x] Cache eviction endpoint rate limiting (30s cooldown)

### Security Headers
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [x] X-Frame-Options: DENY
- [x] X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- [x] Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- [x] CORS headers properly configured

### Input Validation
- [x] Steam ID format validation (17 digits, starts with 7656119)
- [x] Vanity URL validation (3-32 chars, alphanumeric + underscore/hyphen)
- [x] Parameter sanitization in all handlers

### Logging Security
- [x] No sensitive values (API keys, tokens) logged
- [x] Structured logging with appropriate levels
- [x] Request/response tracking without sensitive data

## Additional Security Measures Needed

### Environment Variables
- [ ] Environment variable validation
- [ ] Startup security checks
- [ ] Required variable existence validation

### Template Security
- [ ] HTML escaping for dynamic content
- [ ] CSP headers if serving HTML
- [ ] Input sanitization for template variables

### Enhanced Rate Limiting
- [ ] Per-endpoint rate limiting
- [ ] Whitelist for trusted IPs
- [ ] Configurable rate limits via environment variables

### Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Security event logging
- [ ] Metrics for security events
- [ ] Health check endpoint security

### Production Hardening
- [ ] Remove debug endpoints in production
- [ ] HTTPS redirect implementation
- [ ] Request timeout middleware
- [ ] Graceful shutdown with timeout

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Error Path Testing
- [x] Invalid Steam ID formats
- [x] Rate limiting behavior
- [x] Cache failure scenarios
- [x] Steam API outage simulation

### Security Testing
- [ ] XSS prevention tests
- [ ] CSRF protection tests  
- [ ] Header injection tests
- [ ] Path traversal tests

### Load Testing
- [ ] Concurrent request handling
- [ ] Memory leak detection under load
- [ ] Cache performance under pressure
- [ ] Rate limiter effectiveness under burst traffic

## Deployment Security

### Infrastructure
- [ ] TLS/SSL configuration
- [ ] Firewall rules
- [ ] Container security scanning
- [ ] Secrets management

### Monitoring
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] Security event alerting
- [ ] Performance degradation detection
- [ ] Steam API quota monitoring
