# Security & Production Readiness Checklist

## âœ… Completed Security Measures

### Error Handling & Information Disclosure
- [x] Structured error responses with consistent format
- [x] No sensitive information in error messages
- [x] Proper HTTP status codes for different error types
- [x] Request ID tracking for error correlation

### Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection
- [x] Global rate limiting middleware (100 req/min per IP)
- [x] Token bucket algorithm implementation
- [x] Steam API rate limit handling with backoff
- [x] Cache eviction endpoint rate limiting (30s cooldown)

### Security Headers
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [x] X-Frame-Options: DENY
- [x] X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- [x] Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- [x] CORS headers properly configured

### Input Validation
- [x] Steam ID format validation (17 digits, starts with 7656119)
- [x] Vanity URL validation (3-32 chars, alphanumeric + underscore/hyphen)
- [x] Parameter sanitization in all handlers

### Logging Security
- [x] No sensitive values (API keys, tokens) logged
- [x] Structured logging with appropriate levels
- [x] Request/response tracking without sensitive data

## ðŸ”„ Additional Security Measures Needed

### Environment Variables Security
- [ ] Implement environment variable validation
- [ ] Add startup security checks
- [ ] Validate required environment variables exist

### Template Security (if used)
- [ ] HTML escaping for any dynamic content
- [ ] CSP headers if serving HTML
- [ ] Input sanitization for template variables

### Additional Rate Limiting
- [ ] Per-endpoint rate limiting (different limits for different endpoints)
- [ ] Whitelist for trusted IPs
- [ ] Configurable rate limits via environment variables

### Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Security event logging (failed auth, rate limit exceeded)
- [ ] Metrics for security events
- [ ] Health check endpoint security

### Production Hardening
- [ ] Remove debug endpoints in production
- [ ] Implement proper HTTPS redirect
- [ ] Add request timeout middleware
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown with timeout

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Error Path Testing
- [x] Invalid Steam ID formats
- [x] Rate limiting behavior
- [x] Cache failure scenarios
- [x] Steam API outage simulation

### Security Testing
- [ ] XSS prevention tests
- [ ] CSRF protection tests  
- [ ] Header injection tests
- [ ] Path traversal tests

### Load Testing
- [ ] Concurrent request handling
- [ ] Memory leak detection under load
- [ ] Cache performance under pressure
- [ ] Rate limiter effectiveness under burst traffic

## Deployment Security

### Infrastructure
- [ ] TLS/SSL configuration
- [ ] Firewall rules
- [ ] Container security scanning
- [ ] Secrets management

### Monitoring
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] Security event alerting
- [ ] Performance degradation detection
- [ ] Steam API quota monitoring
